## <a name="introduction">✨ Introduction</a>

A fully interactive macOS-inspired desktop experience featuring a fluid animated Dock with realistic physics. This portfolio includes draggable, resizable application windows like Finder, Safari, Photos, and Terminal packed with smooth GSAP animations.

The interface offers full dark mode support and seamlessly adapts to mobile with an iOS-style layout. Built with modular, reusable components, it showcases a complete window management system with open, close, and focus states for a premium, desktop-like experience in the browser.

## <a name="tech-stack">⚙️ Tech Stack</a>

- **[React](https://reactjs.org)** is a declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables efficient UI development through its virtual DOM implementation and reusable component architecture with hooks for state and lifecycle management.

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** is a strongly typed programming language built on JavaScript that adds static type checking. It provides enhanced developer experience with better IDE support, early error detection, and improved code maintainability at scale.

- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** is a next-generation frontend build tool that offers lightning-fast development server startup and instant hot module replacement. It leverages native ES modules for rapid development and provides optimized production builds with minimal configuration.

- **[GSAP](https://gsap.com)** is a professional-grade JavaScript animation library that delivers high-performance, butter-smooth animations. It provides precise control over sequencing, timing, and complex motion paths with cross-browser compatibility.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)** is a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development through composable classes. It provides design system consistency with responsive modifiers, state variants, and just-in-time compilation for optimal performance.

- **[Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs)** is a minimal, hook-based state management library for React. It lets you manage global state with zero boilerplate, no context providers, and excellent performance through selective state subscriptions.

- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)** is an opinionated code formatter that enforces consistent code style automatically. It eliminates formatting discussions in code reviews and integrates seamlessly into development workflows for clean, readable code.

- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)** is a pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and TypeScript. It identifies and reports problematic patterns in code, helping maintain code quality, consistency, and catching potential bugs early in development.
